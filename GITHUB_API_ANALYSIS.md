### Overall Assessment

**Well Implemented (90%+ coverage):**
- ✅ Authentication & user management
- ✅ Basic repository operations
- ✅ File management (CRUD)
- ✅ Branch management
- ✅ Issues (basic CRUD + comments)
- ✅ Pull Requests (basic CRUD + merge)
- ✅ Releases (full CRUD)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (runs, logs, dispatch)
- ✅ Gists
- ✅ Notifications (basic)
- ✅ Organizations
- ✅ User settings (comprehensive)

**Partially Implemented / In Progress:**
- ⚠️ Commits (diff viewing, but no compare)
- ⚠️ GitHub Actions (missing advanced features)
- ⚠️ Issues Advanced (timeline, lock/unlock, reactions and comment edit/delete implemented; remaining gaps are issue events and deeper timeline event actions)
- ⚠️ Notifications (missing thread subscription)

**Not Implemented / Early Coverage — Major Gaps:**
- ❌ Repository teams
- ⚠️ Advanced PR features (review comments, check runs, reviewers, review history and merge methods implemented; remaining gaps are review mutation/detail and check suites)
- ⚠️ Advanced issue features (timeline, lock/unlock, reactions, edit/delete comments implemented; remaining gaps are issue events and deeper timeline event actions)
- ❌ Discussions
- ❌ Projects (classic & V2)
- ⚠️ Webhooks (list/create/update/delete/ping plus delivery history/redelivery implemented; remaining gaps are advanced config/test helpers)
- ⚠️ Security features (Dependabot, code scanning and secret scanning alerts implemented; advisory management and enable/disable controls still missing)
- ❌ Packages
- ⚠️ Repository rulesets (list/detail/rule suites implemented; create/update/delete still missing)
- ❌ Advanced search (commits, issues, topics)

### Recommendations for Next Implementation

**High Priority (would add significant value):**
1. **Repository Teams** — Org repo team permissions

**Medium Priority:**
2. **Discussions** — If the app targets communities
3. **Projects** — If project management is needed

**Low Priority (nice to have):**
4. **Security Tab** — advisories and enable/disable controls
5. **Packages** — GitHub Packages integration
